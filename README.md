## AirPollution-Proteome-Diseases-Mediation

![graphical overview](./src/overall.png)

## Description
This repository provides a reproducible R codebase and figure scripts for a study on the air pollution–proteome–disease axis. It covers data derivation, proteome-wide association study (PWAS), time-to-event modeling for both air pollution and proteome predictors, causal mediation analysis identifying protein mediators, construction of an air-pollution–mediated proteomic risk score (APPRS), and predictive modeling via LASSO. The goal is to quantify the effects of ambient air pollution on disease risk and to dissect the proteomic pathways that mediate these effects.

## Methods
We implement PWAS, Cox models for air pollution ~ disease outcomes and proteome ~ disease outcomes, mediation to identify potential protein mediators, APPRS construction and airpollution interaction analyses, and LASSO-based prediction in R.
